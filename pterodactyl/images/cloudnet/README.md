# Info
This image seems useless if you don't want to connect Pterodactyl and Cloudnet. You can download the egg here [keksgauner/eggs/cloudnet](https://github.com/keksgauner/eggs/tree/master/minecraft/cloudnetv3)

Due to the absence of an image that incorporates the Docker IP during the start in the config.json, I have created a Docker image that writes the Docker IP for Pterodactyl.

Since there is no existing image that includes the Docker IP during the configuration process in the config.json file, I have developed a Docker image specifically designed to insert the Docker IP for Pterodactyl.

There are several possibilities. Either the image I built is used or you build it yourself. Decide for yourself.
- [CloudNet](https://github.com/keksgauner/docker-stuff/tree/main/pterodactyl/images/cloudnet)
  - `keksgauner/cloudnet:latest`
  - `hub.docker.com/r/keksgauner/cloudnet`
