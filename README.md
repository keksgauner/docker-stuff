# Docker Stuff
"Docker-Tools" is a project that provides a collection of example files for NGINX configurations and Docker stuff.
Here you can find docker images, docker compose files and nginx configurations.

I use these things myself for private purposes and may become obsolete when I no longer use them.

# Docker compose files

Here are docker-compose.yml files to support different applications. The Nginx configurations could be helpful here

Additional docker compose files can be found at [PAPAMICA](https://github.com/PAPAMICA/docker-compose-collection)

### phpmyadmin_mariadb

- [phpmyadmin_mariadb](https://github.com/keksgauner/docker-stuff/tree/main/composes-files/default/phpmyadmin_mariadb.yml)

# Nginx configurations

Is not exclusively for docker purposes but exists probably because of the docker compose files purposes.

# Pterodactyl Images

Docker images that can be used with the Pterodactyl egg system. You can request more images by opening a new issue.

Additional Pterodactyl images can be found at [Software-Noob](https://github.com/Software-Noob/pterodactyl-images), [Parkervcp](https://github.com/parkervcp/images), [Matthewpi](https://github.com/matthewpi/images) and [Yolks](https://github.com/pterodactyl/yolks) repositories.

These Pterodactyl images probably exist because of this repository [keksgauner/eggs](https://github.com/keksgauner/eggs)
