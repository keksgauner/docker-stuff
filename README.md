# Docker Stuff
"Docker-Tools" is a project that provides a collection of example files for NGINX configurations and Docker stuff.
Here you can find docker images, docker compose files and nginx configurations.

I use these things myself for private purposes and may become obsolete when I no longer use them.

# Pterodactyl Images

Docker images that can be used with the Pterodactyl egg system. You can request more images by opening a new issue.

Additional Pterodactyl images can be found at [Software-Noob](https://github.com/Software-Noob/pterodactyl-images), [Parkervcp](https://github.com/parkervcp/images), [Matthewpi](https://github.com/matthewpi/images) and [Yolks](https://github.com/pterodactyl/yolks) repositories.

These images probably exist because of this repository [keksgauner/eggs](https://github.com/keksgauner/eggs)
